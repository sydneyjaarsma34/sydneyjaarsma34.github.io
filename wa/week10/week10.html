          For this project, I used a Chuck Norris API that I found off the web to generate random (definitely true) facts. The extension that I implemented was a loading spinner that appears when the user clicks the 'generate new fact' button. It appears to spin for a half second before the fact actually appears.

          For my critique project (critique of Netflix), I might be able to use an API to generate facts about or images from a movie to enhance the user experience and give the user more information about the titles they may want to watch. Maybe a user could click on an expanding card that generates some facts about the movie. I might be able to use an API like TMDb to get this data.
