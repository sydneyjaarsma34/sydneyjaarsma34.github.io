            <h1>Post Assignment Reflection</h1>
                <p>Using Flexbox for the cards makes sure that the title and 
                    expand button are aligned on every card, making it much easier to read and understand at a glance.
                    However in relation to the button, the user has to want to know more information in order to see the whole card. 
                    This design can benefit users who prefer less cluttered layouts and it could make it easier to navigate the page if you know what you need to look for. Especially for keyboard 
                    users, it's pretty easy to tab through all the expand buttons. 
                    At the same time, it can disadvantage users who prefer to scan all information 
                    at once. Also my screen reader didn't pick up on the expand button and just read all of the content; I'm not sure how to change that.</p>

                    <p>By default, the designer assumes that certain summaries are more important than full details, which changes 
                    what users see first and what requires more effort to see. In the 
                    context of the example Community Resource project, the choice of hiding some information determines the importance of the information. Contact information 
                    is hidden, so it wasn't important enough to be shown immediately. While collapsing content can reduce 
                    distraction and help with focus for some, it also risks creating barriers to access, particularly for users who 
                    rely on quick scanning or assistive technologies. </p>
